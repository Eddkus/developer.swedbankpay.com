## E-commerce Direct API

{% include alert.html type="neutral"
                      icon="info"
                      body="Swish is a one-phase payment instrument supported by the
                      major Swedish banks. In the direct e-commerce scenario,
                      Swedbank Pay receives the Swish registered mobile number
                      directly from the merchant UI. Swedbank Pay performs a
                      payment that the payer confirms using her Swish mobile
                      app." %}

## Introduction

* When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request towards
  Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information.
* The next step is to collect the consumer's Swish registered mobile number
  and make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay to create a sales transaction.
* Swedbank Pay will handle the dialogue with Swish and the consumer will have to
  confirm the purchase in the Swish app.
* If `CallbackURL` is set, you will receive a payment callback when the Swish
  dialogue is completed.
* Make a `GET` request to check the payment status.

This flow is explained in the sequence diagram below.

## API Requests

The API requests are displayed in the [purchase flow](#purchase-flow).
Swish is a one-phase payment instrument that is based on sales transactions not
involving `capture` or `cancellation` operations.
The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation
set to value `Purchase` are listed below.

### Options before posting a payment

All valid options when posting in a payment with operation equal to `Purchase`.

#### General

* **Defining CallbackURL**: When implementing a scenario, it is optional to set
  a [CallbackURL][callback-url] in the `POST` request. If `callbackURL` is set,
  Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer has
  fulfilled the payment.

## Purchase flow

The sequence diagram below shows the three requests you have to send to
Swedbank Pay to make a purchase.

  activate Browser
  Browser->>-Merchant: start purchase
  activate Merchant
  Merchant->>-SwedbankPay: POST <Swish payment> (operation=PURCHASE)
  activate  SwedbankPay
  note left of Merchant: First API request

  activate Merchant

  activate Merchant
  Merchant->>- SwedbankPay: GET <Sales transaction>
  activate  SwedbankPay
   SwedbankPay-->>-Merchant: Payment response
  activate Merchant
  Merchant-->>-Browser: Payment Status
```

**Redirect and Payment Status**  
After the payment is confirmed, the consumer will be redirected from the Swish
app to the completeUrl set in the first API request `POST` [Create
payment][create-payment] and you need to retrieve payment status with `GET`
[Sales transaction][sales-transaction] before presenting a confirmation page to
the consumer.

## M-commerce Direct API

{% include alert.html type="neutral"
                      icon="info"
                      body="Swish is an one-phase payment instrument supported by
                      the major Swedish banks. When implementing the direct
                      m-commerce scenario, Swedbank Pay performs a payment that
                      the consumer/end-user confirms directly through the Swish
                      mobile app." %}

## Introduction

  request towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information.

* Swedbank Pay will handle the dialogue with Swish and the consumer will have to
  confirm the purchase in the Swish app.
* If `CallbackURL` is set you will receive a payment callback when the Swish
  dialogue is completed, and you will have to make a `GET` request to check the
  payment status.

The flow is explained in the sequence diagram below.
