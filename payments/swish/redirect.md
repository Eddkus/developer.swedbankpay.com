>Swish is an one-phase payment instrument supported by the major Swedish banks.
 In the redirect e-commerce scenario, Swedbank Pay performs a payment that the
 payer confirms using her Swish mobile app.
 The consumer initiates the payment by supplying the Swish registered mobile
 number (MSISDN), connected to the Swish app.

## Introduction

* When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request towards
  Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information. This will generate a
  payment object with a unique `paymentID`. You either receive a Redirect URL to
  a hosted page or a JavaScript source in response.
* You need to [redirect][redirect] the payer to the Redirect payment page or
  embed the script source on you site to create a [Hosted View][hosted-view] in
  an iFrame; where she is prompted to enter the Swish registered mobile number.
  This triggers the initiation of a sales transaction.
* Swedbank Pay handles the dialogue with Swish and the consumer confirms the
  purchase in the Swish app.
* Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer's browser to - or display directly in the
  iFrame - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment session
  is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note that both
  a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled
  payment.
* If CallbackURL is set you will receive a payment callback when the Swish
  dialogue is completed. You need to do a `GET` request, containing the
  `paymentID` generated in the first step, to receive the state of the
  transaction.

## Screenshots
