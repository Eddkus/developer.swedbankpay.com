# Swish e-commerce Direct API

{% include alert.html type="neutral"
                      icon="info"
                      body="Swish is a one-phase payment instrument supported by the
                      major Swedish banks. In the direct e-commerce scenario,
                      Swedbank Pay receives the Swish registered mobile number
                      directly from the merchant UI. Swedbank Pay performs a
                      payment that the payer confirms using her Swish mobile
                      app." %}

## Introduction

* When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request towards
  Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information.
* After that you need to collect the consumer's Swish registered mobile number
  and make a POST request towards  Swedbank Pay, to create a sales transaction.
* Swedbank Pay will handle the dialogue with Swish and the consumer will have to
  confirm the purchase in the Swish app.
* If CallbackURL is set you will receive a payment callback when the Swish
  dialogue is completed, and you will have to make a `GET` request to check the
  payment status.
* The flow is explained in the sequence diagram below.

## API Requests

The API requests are displayed in the [purchase flow](#purchase-flow).
Swish is a one-phase payment instrument that is based on sales transactions not
involving capture or cancellation operations.
The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation
set to Value Purchase are listed below.

### Options before posting a payment

All valid options when posting in a payment with operation equal to Purchase.

#### General

* **Defining CallbackURL**: When implementing a scenario, it is optional to set
  a [CallbackURL][callback-url] in the `POST` request. If callbackURL is set
  Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer has
  fulfilled the payment.

## Purchase flow

The sequence diagram below shows the three requests you have to send to
Swedbank Pay to make a purchase.

  [Swedbank Pay admin portal][payex-admin-portal].

completed sales transaction.
